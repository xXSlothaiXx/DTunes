#Creating DTunes 2.0!!!!

It's been a long time since we've looked at this app and were going to add some MUCH awatied features we've been trying to get. DTunes 2.0 will make the open source music player TRULY comparable to spotify or some other music streaming service. The goal is to try and connect users while allowing them to store their music on chosen hardware

##Features!!!!

New features for 2.0

### AUTOPLAY!!!
Right now DTunes allows a user to select a song and just play it. We want to take it to the next level and allow songs to autoplay in the background. For this to work we will need our app to do this....

# 1.) BACKGROUND widget for playing music
	* We need a player widget that is always on the frontend when a song is playing
	* It needs to display the current song that is in the queue. 
	* It should have the play pause function
	* it should route to the player dart page 

# 2.) SONG Cycler
	* Implement a Queue for listing songs
	* Autoplay method that plays a song and then goes to the next
	* Be able to pass in a list of songs like (Playlist, Songs, Reccomended)

# 3.) Reccomendation System: 
	* Look at current artist of song and scrape youtube urls with channel videos with the same name
	* FAR OUT (Group songs in genre if possible)
